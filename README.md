# README
This folder is the remote origin for my config repository
The 'sync' folder contains config for my nvim, a copy of my .zshrc, and a copy of tmux.conf

Run the script inside "sync" to make a copy of my .zshrc here

Current issues with my vim config:
- All lsp errors are prefaced with 'typescript' for some reason
- I wasn't seeing the warning that I usually see in VSCode for images needing an alt tag
